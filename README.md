# Four Way Arrow Button

FourWayArrowButton is a custom view. It is a nice template for Android programmers who want to develop 2D games without using a game engine. For me, I have helped me understand the custom view creation development and "Listener" topic better. You can download a small application and its codes from Github link.
I will have two-dimensional game development projects without using a game engine, which is only a small part of it. When I develop my game, I will share it on my Google Play page. This project is an example I made just to set an example for new friends, and I needed such a simple code while I was learning.
